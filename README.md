# chaselib
Python library for dead simple audio experimentation.

## Summary

Basically I got sick of trying to remember how to do low level audio boilerplate everytime I wanted to experiment with some crazy audio-related concept. This library exists basically just to turn an array of floats referrenced from -1.0 to +1.0 into an audio file which can be played by the OS. As I go along, additional functionallity will probably be added as I need it.
